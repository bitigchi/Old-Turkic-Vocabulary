## Typing Guide

* Use original Old Turkic tamgas/runes.
* If available, Uyghur-era spelling is preferred.
* Transliteration is indicated via lowercase letters. If a vowel is not shown in the runic script, it is indicated via a capital letter in the Latin transliteration.
* `tr_translation` is a required field. If you do not speak-know Turkish, feel free to enter a duplicate `en_translation`, we'll sort them out.

If you have SQL knowledge, and have experience in creating dictionaries, feel free to reach out to me; any technical help is always welcome.
